I am currently a Year 3 PhD candidate at Nanyang Technological University (NTU), supervised by [Prof. Lihua Xie](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=Fmrv3J8AAAAJ&hl=en) from NTU and co-supervised by [Dr. Yau Wei-Yun](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=B_VchHYAAAAJ&hl=en) from Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR), Singapore. Before that, I received my M. Eng. degree (2022) and B. Eng. degree (2019) from Zhejiang University (ZJU), under the supervision of [Prof. Ronghao Zheng](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=LxgdmqYAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research primarily focuses on planning and optimization problems in multi-robot systems, including autonomous exploration, active SLAM, and formal-method-based planning. I am passionate about developing autonomous robotic systems for real-world deployment, with a particular emphasis on uncovering the mathematical foundations underlying practical challenges.
